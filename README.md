# Equipment-Database

#This is the database (or more specifically, the GitHub repository for the database). I f**ked up and saved over the actual .RDATA file as the database was almost 100% done, so now I get to play catch-up as well as develop better tendencies moving forward. With this repository, I'll be able to just push my code here to have it backed up with ease. 

#This addition is from RStudio
